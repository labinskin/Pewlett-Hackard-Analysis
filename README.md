# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

##### Overview:

Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

- A quick sum of the retirement_titles table reveals that there are 90,398 employees that will be eligible to retire from the company. This is a large section of the workforce at the company and will not be easily replaced.

- The two largest areas come from senior positions, Staff and Engineer, making these areas hardest hit. With Engineer and Staff being the third and fourth leading titles for retirements respectively. The Staff and Engineer departments are going to be the hardest hit and need the most replacements.

- To get further insight into the mentorship data, I broke it down two different ways. This table shows the total number of those eligible for mentorship from what Bobby's manager requested. That total is 1,549, a mere fraction of the total number retiring or .017% of the total.

- The second way I broke down the mentorship data was by job title. The good news is that there eligible employees in the Staff and Senior Engineer titles, with fewer being around in the Engineer and Senior Staff positions.
